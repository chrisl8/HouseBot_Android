HouseBot_Android
================

An Android App to Control an Lego NXT robot using LeJOS

This provides both an on screen interface, that works best with a VNC server installed on the tablet, and a web interface.

You will also need the code from HouseBot_LeJOS and HouseBot_LeJOS_SharedResources to run on the Lego NXT. This will require the LeJOS firmware on the NXT.
